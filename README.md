How to use
----------
The code runs on SuperCollider - system used was a Mac version 10.7.4
with SuperCollider 3.6.5 (and also tested on Ubuntu 13.04).

The best way to start poking is to run SuperCollider IDE, then
open up the file "scrunall_selfcontrolled.scd", select all, and run it.
It does take a little while to initialise everything.
