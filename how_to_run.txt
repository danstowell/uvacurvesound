HOW TO RUN A SEQUENCE

* Run the bash script "runme_selfcontrolled.scd" using Terminal


HOW TO RUN SC BUT WAIT FOR d3 TO CONTROL

* Run the bash script ./runme_d3controlled.bash




In both cases, the way to terminate is by switching back to the Terminal (cmd+tab) and then pressing ctrl-c to quit.






HOW TO EDIT STUFF:

If you run the SuperCollider app (in the dock) it should resume the editing session.
